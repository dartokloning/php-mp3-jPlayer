PHP MP3 File reader. 
Reads a directory of MP3 files, and obtains the MP3 meta data contained
in each file, then displays a jPlayer object to listen to the file.

Upload your mp3 files into the mp3/ directory, and the application 
dynamically displays the contents of the directory's mp3 songs/files
for listening.
